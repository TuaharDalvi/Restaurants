           At the point when ‘sea view’ organizer Tony ventured off the shorelines of Oahu following a multi-day of<br> surfing with his Navy pals in the mid-60s, he did what worked out easily for him. He went hunting down a delicious burger, a hot container of fries,<br> and a virus drink.
            
            After twenty years, in 1982, it was that feeling of peace and fulfillment he was attempting to reproduce when he took a little piece of the ‘sea view’s <br>and thudded it down right in the territory of Southern California.
            
            Today, ‘sie view’s still is consistent with Tony’s <br>unique experience and his unique vision. Also, however, our menu has developed to incorporate plates of mixed greens, soups, and delicate tacos.</p>
